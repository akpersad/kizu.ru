# Private and Public CSS Variables

#Practical #CSS_Variables #CSS

_I have a lot of ideas and research around CSS variables, but could not find a place to start. Finally, I have decided to write shorter posts and then I would try to link them together. This my the first article about usage of CSS variables for modern Web development._

## The Terms

(Need to have a link to Lea's article here) https://lea.verou.me/2021/10/custom-properties-with-defaults/

What I would talk about here would be conventions and their consequences — there cannot be real “private” CSS variables, so all the difference from “public” ones would be in how they're supposed to be used (and I would talk less about how to name them, as this is secondary).

(Need to clarify that I'm talking about naming of the moving parts of components, not naming and usage of design tokens as this is a completely different thing)

(When talking about naming, mention that there are a lot of projects that automate it for classnames, making them generated and isolated, but not a lot of them do the same for CSS variables, when in practice it would be really nice to have, especially for the private ones.)
